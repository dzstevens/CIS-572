Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a relatively new investment opportunity with a fairly simple model.
Prospective investors fund loans for propective borrowers,  who then pay them  back at an interest rate 
based on the borrower's credit history. Unlike traditional investments, the return-on-investment comes from the 
interest paid, rather than an increase in property value. The risk, in turn, is based on the possibility that a 
loan will default before it is fully paid off. Lending Club, an American P2P lending company, 
publishes extensive historical and current data about each loan and its requester. This paper applies standard 
machine learning techniques to the historical data with the goal of creating a classifier that can be used to 
choose loans with the highest likely returns. Unfortunately, this approach fails to outperfom average rates 
for fully-diversified investments, though it does serve as a good baseline for future work in this novel area.
